            When you're reading this, we're gonna be at Bonaroo! I'm currently sitting 
            at work and trying to figure out how this whole coding a website thing works.
            So here's the idea behind the "gift" if you would call it that. I wanted to make a website for us, where we can keep a sort of online photo/video album of pretty much just us. Anything, from when we travel, hike, hit up music festivals, chill at home, and just about do anything together that we photograph or record, can be put onto here. We can also write small excerpts under the images/videos if we want of a certain memory or something funny we'd just like to point out, or anything, its completely up to us. And the good thing about this, is that I have all the source code, as well as plenty of backups, so we will never worry about losing these. As you can see, I've already added quite alot of content, and as far as anything you'd like to add, you can text them to me whenever and I can add them, or I can even show you how to when we get home. Anyways, I wanted a place for me to be able to permanently keep all the memories with you I have enjoyed, and I hope you like the idea of this and will add to it for a long time to come. I love you Grace, and happy birthday.

        <p style="color: #E7DFDD"> Well this was one of our first pictures our dumbasses took together...one of the few things I remember from that date function was the fact that I rolled up to our manor house and didn't have you...because i thought you were coming seperately. Smh. I thought u looked banging in that red dress though hence why I asked you to dinner, and you almost kinda shut me down. This is the only picture I have of us from September, if you have any send them to me!</p>

        <p style="color: #E7DFDD"> You look fucking dead in this picture Grace. There is like nothing else to say about it. One of the earlier times we boinked though. It was probably under 5 times at this point, and I captured you in your natural hungover-in-the-morning state! fresh.

        <p style="color: #E7DFDD"> I know you like this picture alot bc its super gay. this was at bearfence and was our first super fruity date because after the date I remember on the drive back we talked about dating and that kind of stuff and we had pretty similar views but it was a nerve-racking conversation for me because I didn't know how you would take it/if I should open up to you about that yet(gay i know). I also remember trying to light that joint and I think we each got about 2 hits each before it just crumbled away lol. I miss our rock, we should go back...and touch each other up there(when it's not cold).</p>

This was when Celeste was pouring beer into my mouth and your ass was havin none of it and came up and starting aggressively making out with me. That shit was hot. You also tried getting in some random person's car bc you were drunk and I told you to stop being a fucking idiot and you got mad at me for being a reasonable/non-dumbass adult. Ahh fun times. I took you home that night and you cried outside your apartment door for about 10 minutes because you said you wanted to sleep with me and make sure I studied for my history final which was on Monday..and it was a Saturday. Smh. I went home and drank with the boys though hahahahha. </p>

        <p style = "color: #E7DFDD"> This was during break when we went on that hike in Forest Park. You literally tried throwing this fucking rock into that stick hoop about 80 times and you got it in this video, and the fuckin epic sounding song started. Great vid.  We gotta go back to that place there are so many trails baby. And we gotta see if we can find those fucking beavers. Haha and remember when I dropped your phone in the water tryna jump that water.

Idk why all these videos kinda freeze at the end so it doesn't capture your chin movements as much as it like...especially whilst chewing on food. I gotta try to figure out how to fix that, it's gotta be a code thing possibly idk. But yeah the angle and everything.just quality videomanship. </p>
